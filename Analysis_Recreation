Instructions to replicate a demographic analysis using Python, along with the key findings:

To replicate the demographic analysis:

1. Load the Dataset:
   - Obtain a dataset (provided in ‘datasets’ folder).
   - Use Pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, data type conversions, and removing duplicates(if required).

3. Perform Calculations:
   - Conduct demographic calculations, such as mean, median, mode, and aggregations based on demographics provided.
   - Calculate workers percentage based on industrial category and age.

4. Create Visualizations:
   - Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
   - Generate various plots like bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts to represent demographic distributions.
